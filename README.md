## Application Details

This repository contains two scripts, `go.sh` and `bot.sh`, which are part of the ChatSnap application. The first script, `go.sh`, manages data uploads and logging, while the second script, `bot.sh`, interacts with a chatbot.

## 1. Getting Started

This guide is intended to help you run the ChatSnap application and manage its processes.

## 2. Managing Processes

The scripts (`go.sh` and `bot.sh`) will first check for any existing processes (`chainlit` and `dataManager.py`) and will stop them before starting fresh instances. This ensures that there are no conflicts with previously running applications.

The `chainlit` process and `dataManager.py` script will then be run in the background. The scripts display the PIDs (Process IDs) for both processes for your reference.

## 3. Viewing Logs

Logs for both processes are stored in a dedicated `ACTIVE_LOGS` directory. Inside, individual log directories are named by the current date and timestamp.

The output and error logs for both `chainlit` and `dataManager.py` can be found within these directories, named as follows:

- `chainlit_output.log` and `chainlit_error.log` for `bot.sh`
- `fileupload_output.log` and `fileupload_error.log` for `go.sh`

To monitor the logs in real-time, you can use commands like `tail -f`:

```bash
tail -f ACTIVE_LOGS/[YOUR_TIMESTAMP]/chainlit_output.log
```

Replace `[YOUR_TIMESTAMP]` with the specific directory timestamp.

## 4. Requirements

Before executing the scripts, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

1. The `chainlit` command must be available in your shell.
2. Python3 should be installed.
3. All the Python libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file should be installed. As this file is already a part of the repository, you can set it up using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 5. Ending Your Session

When you wish to stop the processes:

1. Use the provided PIDs by the scripts to kill the processes.
   ```bash
   kill [CHAINLIT_PID]
   kill [DATAMANAGER_PID]
   ```
